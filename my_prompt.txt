I am a UI/UX developer. I have an e-commerce website project called "Mitra Safety Indonesia". I want to create the UI/UX (HTML, CSS, JavaScript / Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Zustand) for this project. The "Mitra Safety Indonesia" project will operate in Indonesia and focus on the Indonesian market. I request your help to produce a UI/UX that:

Uses appropriate color contrast.

Uses semantic HTML & provides alt text: apply correct HTML tags (e.g., <nav>, <button>) and supply meaningful alt text for all images so screen readers can describe them.

Renders and functions correctly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, and works smoothly on iPhone, Android phones, and tablets.

Has a compact and simple page layout.

Produces medium-sized files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript / Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Zustand) — not too large, not too small.

Is targeted at a beginner–intermediate e-commerce site level (not expert).

Is easy to maintain and debug at a beginner–intermediate level.

Prioritizes web performance (speed).
